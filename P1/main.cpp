// We are going to create an "event simulation" program. All of these events should be created and prioritized through
// their timestamp. The queue will act as a clock and will be loaded with some initial events.
// Refer to the "Discrete Event Simulation" section in the Class 11 slides.

// It is recommended that you store key-pair types of the form (timestamp, event)
// Then pop event E with the smallest timestamp, simulate what happened between t_last and t_current
// Simulate E, set t_last to t_current.

    // The base of this program is the "event loop," which will keep track of and execute events in the order they should be done in.
    while(!q.empty()) {
        Event* next_event = q.top();
